##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionaliity

### Day 1: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created Repo and initialized CRA for new website to be hosted at http://www.creative.us.com

**Thoughts:** I struggled for focus on a single task. I have a long term goal to solving issues I am having with twitter passport login and create-react-app, but was not motivated to make progress today. I'll get to it tomorrow. I also want to use graphql instead of mongodb on my current backend. However, I set up the repo for mongodb initially. I'll have to change later.
