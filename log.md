# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionaliity

### Day 1: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created Repo and initialized CRA for new website to be hosted at http://www.creative.us.com

**Thoughts:** I struggled for focus on a single task. I have a long term goal to solving issues I am having with twitter passport login and create-react-app, but was not motivated to make progress today. I'll get to it tomorrow. I also want to use graphql instead of mongodb on my current backend. However, I set up the repo for mongodb initially. I'll have to change later.

### Day 2: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Solved Twitter CRA OAuth issue by moving away from `passport-twitter` strategy to `react-twitter-auth` and `react-twitter-auth`. 

**Thoughts:** I wanted to solve the passport-twitter and create-react-app issue myself but found it impossible to solve without much further study. I hope to gain better understanding of http methods to be able to build my own express type service from scratch at some point in the future - not for the purpose of reinventing the wheel but for growing in knowledge and experience
